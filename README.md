# Zeotap Data Science Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the Zeotap Data Science challenge, where I completed various tasks related to eCommerce transactions data. The tasks include Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), building a Lookalike Model, and performing Customer Segmentation using clustering techniques.

The dataset provided for the challenge consists of three files:
- `Customers.csv`
- `Products.csv`
- `Transactions.csv`

### Tasks Completed:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   I performed an extensive EDA to understand the data, uncover hidden patterns, and generate actionable business insights. The analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook, and a PDF report summarizing the key insights was also created.

2. **Lookalike Model**  
   I built a Lookalike Model to recommend 3 similar customers for each of the first 20 customers based on their profile and transaction history. The recommendations are based on customer and product information, and a similarity score is assigned to each recommended customer. The results were stored in the `Lookalike.csv` file.

3. **Customer Segmentation / Clustering**  
   I performed customer segmentation using clustering techniques that utilized both customer profile information and transaction history. I used a clustering algorithm of my choice to segment the customers into groups, calculated clustering metrics such as DB Index, and visualized the clusters.

## File Structure
- `FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf`: PDF report containing the business insights from EDA.
- `FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the exploratory data analysis.
- `FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv`: CSV file containing the top 3 lookalike customers and their similarity scores for each of the first 20 customers.
- `FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for building the Lookalike Model.
- `FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf`: PDF report containing the results of the customer segmentation, including clustering metrics and DB Index value.
- `FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for customer segmentation using clustering.

## Installation and Setup

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. Install the necessary Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to view the analyses and models:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Assessed on the thoroughness of analysis and the quality of insights derived.
- **Business Insights**: Evaluated based on the relevance and depth of insights.
- **Lookalike Model**: Evaluated on the logic, accuracy, and quality of recommendations.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Assessed on clustering logic, evaluation metrics (DB Index), and visual representation of clusters.

## Conclusion
I have successfully completed all the tasks in the challenge, providing insights and building predictive models to help businesses improve their strategies based on data analysis. I look forward to any feedback or further evaluation.
